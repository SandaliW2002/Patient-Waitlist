# Patient-Waitlist
🩺 Patient Waitlist Dashboard (Interactive)
1. Purpose

A fully interactive Power BI dashboard designed to streamline patient waitlist management in healthcare settings. The project demonstrates my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights using advanced data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization techniques.

2. Tech Stack

Power BI – dashboard design, interactive reports, data modeling

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – advanced measures, time intelligence, performance metrics

Data Analysis – cleaning, transformation, trend identification, and KPI reporting

3. Data Source

Simulated patient referral, scheduling, and treatment datasets (adaptable to real-world hospital/clinic data).

Designed to integrate with healthcare databases, CSV/Excel extracts, or APIs.

4. Features & Highlights

📊 Dynamic visualizations: patient flow, referrals, backlog trends, and appointment tracking.

⏳ Wait time analytics: average, median, and maximum wait times to spot bottlenecks.

📈 KPI dashboards: referral-to-treatment performance against healthcare targets.

🏥 Custom views: filter and slice data by clinic, department, or specialty.

🚦 Case prioritization: flags urgent patients to support faster decision-making.

🔄 Scalable design: adaptable to other industries needing waitlist or queue management.

5. What This Project Showcases

Data Visualization Skills – building clear, professional dashboards with business impact.

DAX Expertise – writing complex measures and calculated columns for accurate reporting.

Problem-Solving – transforming healthcare challenges (long waits, bottlenecks) into data-driven solutions.

End-to-End Workflow – from raw data to final dashboard ready for stakeholder use.
